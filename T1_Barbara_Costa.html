<p>There are 15 dish types which are: Stimulant, Healthy, Old Fashioned, Comfort, Breakfast, Plain, Fine Dining, Acquired Taste, Dessert, Soup, Pub, Salad, Exotic, Incredible and Disgusting.</p>

<p>Different Spirits love or hate different dish types, so knowing which is which is important to maintaining a positive attitude for the spirits. Some Items count as some dish types, even though they are not listed like that, such as Wonton Soup being a soup (which is not listed). Additionally, there are un-listed categories that Spirits care about, such as Stanley refusing to eat things made from vegetables and Summer only eating vegan food.</p>

<center><H3><font color="cc6600">List of Recipes</font></h3></center>

<p>There are 105 recipes in Spiritfarer that can be made at a Kitchen (except for Surstromming which is made at the Cellar).
Every dish that is cooked will have a Dish size and at least one Food categories.</p>
